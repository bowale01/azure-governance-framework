### **Practical Implementation Details:**

**What you've implemented:**
```
✅ Automated data discovery using PowerShell scripts
✅ Azure Information Protection label policies
✅ Microsoft Purview data classification rules
✅ Personal data pattern detection (emails, SSNs, credit cards)
```

**Technical talking points:**
- **Data Discovery Script**: "I've written PowerShell automation that scans storage accounts and identifies personal data patterns using regex matching for emails, phone numbers, and sensitive identifiers."
- **Classification Automation**: "We implemented Microsoft Purview with custom classifiers that automatically apply sensitivity labels based on data content analysis."
- **Inventory Maintenance**: "The system maintains a real-time inventory using Azure Monitor queries and generates compliance reports for GDPR Article 30 requirements."

**Practical Example:**
> "For example, I implemented a PowerShell script that scans all storage accounts in a subscription, identifies personal data using pattern matching, and automatically applies Azure Information Protection labels. The script generates a compliance report showing data location, classification level, and GDPR category."

### **Follow-up Questions & Answers:**

**Q: "How do you handle false positives in data classification?"**
**A:** "I implement a two-tier approach: automated detection for obvious patterns, followed by manual review queues for borderline cases. We use Microsoft Purview's confidence scoring and set thresholds that balance automation with accuracy."

**Q: "What about data in SaaS applications?"**
**A:** "For SaaS apps, I use Microsoft Cloud App Security connectors to discover and classify data in Office 365, Salesforce, and other connected apps. The classification follows the same label taxonomy for consistency."

## 2. Identity & Access Management (IAM)

### **Your Answer Structure:**
> "Apply the principle of least privilege using role-based access control (RBAC) and Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to restrict elevated access, with approval workflows and expiration."

### **Practical Implementation Details:**

**What you've implemented:**
```
✅ Custom RBAC roles for data protection officers
✅ PIM configuration with approval workflows
✅ Time-limited access (8-hour maximum for privileged roles)
✅ Automated access reviews every quarter
```

**Technical talking points:**
- **Custom Roles**: "I've created specific roles like 'Data Protection Officer' and 'Compliance Auditor' with granular permissions that align with job functions and compliance requirements."
- **PIM Implementation**: "All privileged roles require approval, MFA, and business justification. Access is time-limited to 8 hours maximum with automatic expiration."
- **Access Reviews**: "Quarterly automated reviews with 14-day response periods, where resource owners must justify continued access."

**Practical Example:**
> "I implemented a Bicep template that creates three custom roles: Data Protection Officer (read-only access to compliance tools), Compliance Auditor (broad read access for auditing), and Data Processor (limited data access for processing personal data). All are integrated with PIM requiring approval workflows."

### **Follow-up Questions & Answers:**

**Q: "How do you handle emergency access scenarios?"**
**A:** "We maintain break-glass accounts with permanent assignments but require immediate notification to security teams and automatic incident creation. All emergency access is logged and reviewed within 24 hours."

**Q: "What about service accounts and automated processes?"**
**A:** "Service accounts use managed identities where possible, with certificate-based authentication for legacy systems. They're assigned the minimum permissions needed and are subject to the same quarterly reviews."

## 3. Compliance Policies & DLP

### **Your Answer Structure:**
> "Enforce Microsoft Purview DLP policies to prevent data leakage and ensure that data transfers (e.g., outside the EU) are logged and controlled."
> 
> "Set up Azure Policy and Blueprints to enforce tagging, encryption, and location-based restrictions."

### **Practical Implementation Details:**

**What you've implemented:**
```
✅ Azure Policies for GDPR storage compliance
✅ DLP policies preventing external data sharing
✅ Location-based deployment restrictions
✅ Automated tagging and encryption enforcement
```

**Technical talking points:**
- **Storage Compliance Policy**: "I created an Azure Policy that automatically enforces GDPR requirements: EU-only regions, customer-managed encryption, HTTPS-only traffic, and no public blob access."
- **DLP Configuration**: "Microsoft Purview DLP policies prevent sharing of classified data externally, with automatic encryption for internal sharing and approval workflows for legitimate business needs."
- **Blueprint Implementation**: "Azure Blueprints ensure consistent policy assignment across environments with automatic remediation for non-compliant resources."

**Practical Example:**
> "My Azure Policy automatically detects storage accounts that don't meet GDPR requirements and either prevents deployment or remediates existing resources. For example, if someone tries to deploy storage in a non-EU region, the policy blocks it and suggests compliant alternatives."

### **Follow-up Questions & Answers:**

**Q: "How do you handle policy exceptions for business requirements?"**
**A:** "We use policy exemptions with business justifications, time limits, and automatic review cycles. Each exemption requires risk assessment and compensating controls, documented in our compliance management system."

**Q: "What about third-party integrations that need data access?"**
**A:** "Third-party access requires data processing agreements, technical safeguards verification, and limited-time access grants. We use Azure Private Link and API Management to control and monitor all external data access."
